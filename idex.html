    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        Before we get into procrastination, what is the key to success? This questions has been asked a countless number of times throughout human history but no one really seems to have the right answer to it. We don't even know if there is a right answer to this since our lives are so complicated and full of wonders and chaos.<br /><br /> A psychologist, however, attempted to answer this question through his discoveries and experiments. Before we go into it though, let's have a little bit of fun.<br /><br /> I happened to come across a couple $25 gift cards for Amazon. You can get yours right now below if you press "Reveal Now!". <em>But</em>, if you wait for some time, you can have an additional $25 gift card for a total of $50!<br /><br />

        <br /><br /><br />DON'T SCROLL PAST THIS POINT IF YOU HAVEN'T FINISHED THE GAME!
    </p>
    <p>
        <br /><br />If you're reading this, then you've either given up, accidentally lost the game, cheated the system by moving your mouse very fast past the boundary, or actually tested your patience and waited until the end (which would be 15 minutes).
        Before you try out the keys, I'm going to be totally honest with you. They're fake. I mean they were too good to be true right? Oh, and another thing. I couldn't figure out how to have the game run for 15 minutes and then reveal both of the fake keys.
        So there's that. If you waited for more than 30 minutes, then maybe an appointment with your doctor would be a good idea.

    <h1>Marshmallow Test</h1>
    <p>
        At this point, you might be wondering what the point of that poorly designed waiting game was about. That was a replica of a well-known test called the Marshmallow Test. The Marshmallow Test is usually conducted on children and the procedure consists of leaving a child alone in a room with a single marshmallow in front of him/her. The child is then told that he/she can eat the marshmallow right now or wait a couple of minutes and the experimenter will bring an additional marshmallow for the child to enjoy.  The study showed that about two-thirds of the children either ate the marshmallow right away or took a couple of minutes to think it over and then ate it. On the other hand, the other third of the children waited for the second marshmallow which the experimenter brought in 15 minutes later.<br /><br />

        This test studied if having the ability to delay instant gratification has any correlation with the person's life. It turns out that there is a significant difference. In fact, the experimenters surveyed the children once they were in high school and found out that those who waited for the second marshmallow had higher grades, were less stressed out, got accepted to better colleges, and were, in general, better off than those who did not wait for the second marshmallow.<br /><br />

        For example, if you look at the charts below, the chart on the left shows the Body Mass Index (BMI) differences between the Non-Delayers (the children who did not wait for the second marshmallow) and the Delayers (the children who waited for the second marshmallow) recorded as a <a href="http://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(12)00737-8/pdf">follow-up study</a> years after the subjects were tested as children. It is clear to see that the average BMI differs by about 3 points which is a significant difference. In fact, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index#Categories">World Health Organization (WHO)</a>, 27.5 (Non-Delayers) is considered <em>Overweight</em> and 24.4 (Delayers) is considered <em>Normal/Healthy</em>.<br /><br />

        On the other hand, the chart on the right shows the Scholastic Aptitude/Assessment Test (SAT) scores between the Non-Delayers and Delayers.
