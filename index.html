    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <h3>Key to Success</h3>
    <p>
        What is the key to success? This questions has been asked a countless
        number of times throughout human history but no one really seems to have
        the right answer to it. In fact, we don't even know if there is a right
        answer to this since our lives are so complicated and full of wonders
        and chaos.<br /><br /> A psychologist, however, attempted to answer this
        question through his research and experiments. Before we go into it though,
        let's have a little bit of fun.<br /><br /> I happened to come across a
        couple $25 gift cards for Amazon. You can get yours right now below if
        you press "Reveal Now!". <em>But</em>, if you wait for some time, you
        can have an additional $25 gift card for a total of $50!<br /><br />
    </p>
    <div class="interactive">
        <canvas id="gameCanvas" width="800px" height="400px" style="background:black;"></canvas>
    </div>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        <br /><br /><br />DON'T SCROLL PAST THIS POINT IF YOU HAVEN'T FINISHED THE GAME!
    </p>
    <p>
        <br /><br />If you're reading this, then you've either given up,
        accidentally lost the game, cheated the system by moving your mouse very
        fast past the boundary, or actually tested your patience and waited until
        the end (which would be 15 minutes). Before you try out the keys, I'm
        going to be totally honest with you. They're fake. I mean they were too
        good to be true right? Oh, and another thing. I couldn't figure out how
        to have the game run for 15 minutes and then reveal both of the fake
        keys. So there's that. If you waited for more than 30 minutes, then
        maybe an appointment with your doctor would be a good idea.
    </p>
    <h3>Marshmallow Test</h3>
    <p>
        At this point, you might be wondering what the point of that poorly
        designed waiting game was about. That was a replica of a well-known test
        called the <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1972-20631-001">Marshmallow Test</a> created by Walter Mischel and Ebbe B. Ebbesen at Stanford University in 1960. The Marshmallow Test is usually conducted
        on children between the ages of 3 and 5, and the procedure consists of
        leaving a child alone in a room with a single marshmallow in front of him/her. The child is then
        told that he/she can eat the marshmallow right now or wait a couple of
        minutes and the experimenter will bring an additional marshmallow for
        the child to enjoy. The study showed that about two-thirds of the
        children either ate the marshmallow right away or took a couple of
        minutes to think it over and then ate it. On the other hand, the other
        third of the children waited for the second marshmallow which the
        experimenter brought in 15 minutes later.<br /><br /> This test studied
        if having the ability to delay instant lesser rewards has any correlation with the
        person's ability to become successful. It turns out that there is a
        significant difference between those who waited and those who did not. In fact, the experimenters surveyed the children
        once they were in high school and found out that those who waited for
        the second marshmallow had higher grades, were less stressed out, got
        accepted to better colleges, and were, in general, better off than those
        who did not wait for the second marshmallow.<br /><br /> For example,
        if you look at the charts below, the chart on the left shows the Body
        Mass Index (BMI) differences between the Non-Delayers (the children who
        did not wait for the second marshmallow) and the Delayers (the children
        who waited for the second marshmallow) recorded as a <a href="http://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(12)00737-8/pdf">follow-up
        study</a> years after the subjects were tested as children. It is clear
        to see that the average BMI differs by about 3 points which is a
        significant difference. In fact, according to
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index#Categories">World
        Health Organization (WHO)</a>, 27.5 (Non-Delayers) is considered
        <em>Overweight</em> and 24.4 (Delayers) is considered
        <em>Normal/Healthy</em>.<br /><br /> On the other hand, the chart on
        the right shows the Scholastic Aptitude/Assessment Test (SAT) scores
        between the Non-Delayers and Delayers. There is about 210 points
        difference in the total score which adds onto the significance
        between the difference in Non-Delayers and Delayers.<br /><br />
    </p>
    <div id="chart_parent">
        <div id="chart_div1"></div>
        <div id="chart_div2"></div>
    </div>
    <p>
        These two charts, however, are only a part of a large follow-up studies
        conducted by multiple psychologists throughout the decades. There are
        other results such as divorce rate, stress level, etc. that demonstrate
        the better quality of life that the Delayers are experiencing compared
        to that of the Non-Delayers. So what is it about not eating a marshmallow
        right away that makes someone successful? The main factor that the
        Delayers have is the ability to delay instant gratification. In fact, the ability
        to delay instant gratification is important in that those who don't have
        this ability are victims of an international epidemic: procrastiation.

    <h1>Procrastination</h1>
    <h3>Non-Procrstinator vs. Procrastinator</h3>
    <p>
        Unless you're a perfect human being, you have probably been affected by
        procrastination. In fact, you might be procrastinating right now by
        reading this article. I mean I have definitely procrastianted and I am
        even procrastinating right now by missing the deadline for this article!
        When people see someone procrastinating, the response is usually "just
        do it!" But come on. Really? That's like telling a clinically depressed
        person "cheer up." We've all been in situations where even though we
        want to work because the deadline is imminent, we end up watching YouTube
        videos about <a href="https://youtu.be/7PA-GzpcgIA?t=402">how to get out
        of a frozen lake that you've just fallen in</a> (I live in Southern
        California so there's literally a 0% chance I'll need to learn how to do
        this but regardless it's an important life skill) and a
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8R5f2kNo0A">kayak-fisherman
        rescuing a wild iguana that happens to be swimming 4 miles offshore</a>.
        <br /><br /> Getting back on the subject of procrastination, first let's
        see some workers in action. Imagine that the red circle below is a worker
        and the blue rectangle is a task that needs to be done. To be exact, the
        task at hand is moving the blue brick from left to right.
    </p>
    <div class="interactive">
        <canvas id="nonProCanvas" width="800px" height="400px" style="background:grey;"></canvas>
    </div>
    <p>
        Here we see a Non-Procrastinator working dilligently on the task. Very efficient wouldn't you say? But this is not how working usually goes as many of you well know.
    </p>
    <div class="interactive">
        <canvas id="proCanvas" width="800px" height="400px" style="background:grey;"></canvas>
    </div>
    <p>
        I'm sure this scenario is more relatable for most people. We are easily
        distracted when working on a task. But why? Why are we so easily
        distracted? This is because most of us don't have the ability to delay
        instant gratification. To elaborate, the task at hand is equivalent to
        staring at the marshmallow right in front of you. It's painful. And how
        can you take the pain away? By doing something else more enjoyable such
        as watching YouTube videos a.k.a. eating the marshmallow!
    </p>
    <h3>Dangers</h3>
    <p>
        We all know what procrstaintion is but what exactly is the definition of procrastiation? Experts define it as the voluntary delay of some task that we intend to do, despite knowing that we will suffer as a result. The key word here is <em>suffer</em>. Procrastination is dangerous as many people will agree with. In fact, it is very easy for a person to become a chronic procrastinator, or someone who procrastinates frequently and consistently. About 20% of adults are considered chronic procrastinators and it is extremelty difficult to break out of the procrastiantion cycle.<br /><br />
        Both the ease of becoming a chronic procrastinator and the difficulty of breaking out of the procrastination cycle stem from the fact that the minds of human tend to reconstruct the sitatuions to make themselves feel beter. For example, let's say Tom is a college student who didn't study for an exam until the night before. Because he didn't have enough time to study for the exam, he recieves a solid C on the exam. Now, unless you don't really mind your GPA, C on an exam is a pretty bad score that will bring down your grade quite a bit if you're aiming for an A. Instead of thinking about the poor work habit, Tom thinks to himself, 'I could've done worse' or 'This is not bad considering I studied the night before.' This process is called downward counterfactual. Downward counterfactual thinking focuses on how the situation could have been worse. This is a common thinking process that many people go through (I'm also guilty of this). By thinking in this way, Tom is not able to focus on how he could have done better in the exam and improve his work habit; instead, by the time the next exam rolls around, he'll think to himeself that he only has to put a little bit more work since he got away with a "respectable" C when he barely studied.<br /><br />
        There are other excuses that people make to feel better about themselves. Many people will say that they work better under pressure or even say that as lnog as the work gets done, it's fine. People reconstruct situations, whether it be consciously or unconsciously, so that they always accomplish "something". As a matter of fact, procrastiation is the absence of progress; recreating the unhealthy situation into something that makes the person temporarily feel good will prevent the person from procrastinating in the future and also add another person into the large pool of chronic procrastinators in the world.
    </p>
    <h3>Process</h3>
    <p>
        Now that we understand the dangers of procrastination, we need to understand how it works so that we can not only recognize when we're procrastinating but also use different countering techniques to break out of the procrastination cycle.<br /><br />
        There are many factors that play into procrastination. We will start with the most basic ones: the type of task at hand.
    </p>
    <h1>Task</h1>
    <h3>Frustration</h3>
    <p>
        The first factor that plays into what kind of task at hand is the frustration level of the task. This frustration can be caused by many reasons such as the task being too difficult, too large, etc. Being frustrated makes one more difficult to focus on a task because frustration causes uncontrollable cognitions and task-irrelevant emotions. In order to manage these frustrations, one is more likely to procrastinate by distracting oneself with other non-frustrating activities.<br /><br />
        Below shows an average person, let's name him Joe, working on three different tasks: not frustration (left), mildly frustrating (middle), and very frustration (right). You can compare the difference in task-completion time by looking at the time (all three start at the same time) and the Work Done counter. As before, the task at hand is moving the rectangular block from left to right. Although, Joe moves the block in a linear fashion, imagine that he moves it a little bit at a time, gets distracted by something, resumes working, and such as you saw above.
    </p>
    <div class="interactive_frust">
        <canvas id="frust0Canvas" width="400px" height="400px" style="background:grey;"></canvas>
        <canvas id="frust1Canvas" width="400px" height="400px" style="background:grey;"></canvas>
        <canvas id="frust2Canvas" width="400px" height="400px" style="background:grey;"></canvas>
    </div>
    <p>
        It is clear to see that the higher frustration is, the longer it takes to copmlete the task which, in this case, represents Joe procrastinating while working. Frustration is only one factor out of many however.
    </p>
    <h3>Personal Meaning</h3>
    <p>
        Another factor related to the task at hand that adds onto the procrastination level is personal meaning. Personal meaning is the extent to which one feels the task at hand is worthwhile pursuit. This includes components of the feature such as fun, pleasure, passion, etc. The lower the personal meaning, the less desirable it is to do the task, which leads to more procrastination.<br /><br />
        Below you'll see Joe again with three different tasks: low frustration + high personal meaning (left), average frustration + average personal meaning (center), and high frustration + low personal meaning.
    </p>
    <div class="interactive_frust_and_pers">
        <canvas id="frpe0Canvas" width="400px" height="400px" style="background:grey;"></canvas>
        <canvas id="frpe1Canvas" width="400px" height="400px" style="background:grey;"></canvas>
        <canvas id="frpe2Canvas" width="400px" height="400px" style="background:grey;"></canvas>
    </div>
    <p>
        Compared to the figure above, it is clear to see that Joe completes the task that is both not frustrating and has high personal meaning versus the task that is only not frustrating. The other extreme is also true; the task that is both very frustrating and has no personal meaning takes a longer time to complete compared to the task that is only very frustrating. With this, we can clearly see that there are many factors that are playing a role in determining the type of task that is at hand.<br /><br />
        We will now go over all of the other factors that play a role in procrastination.
    </p>
    <h3>Boredom</h3>
    <p>
        Similar to frustration, the more boring the task is, the more likely the person is going to deviate towards a task that is less boring. Boring tasks also tend to cause drowsiness and sleepiness which impairs one's ability to work by a great deal.
    </p>
    <h3>Structure</h3>
    <p>
        Structure of the task means how well the task is organized and work through. When a task is less structured and difficult to coordinate, there is more procrastination. This is due to the fact that when one works through a task, there are many points during the process when the person has to make a decision about what to do next and what the next steps are to complete the task. If a task is clearly structured, it is easy for the person to decide what the next steps are and complete the task. On the other hand, if the task is not clearly organized, the indecision between the steps creates more chances for the person to procrastinate.
    </p>
    <h3>Delay</h3>
    <p>
        Delay represents the deadline of the task. Tasks that are due further away in time have lower priorities for people. This is related to the temporal discounting theory: people discount rewards taht are further away. The higher the delay, the more procrastination there is. Delay is a dangerous factor in that there are tasks that have no deadlines. For example, many people for their new year's resolution decide to go on a diet by eating less and going out to the gym more. This is a task that has no deadline; it is a personal task that won't be completed until the person is satisified with the progress. When a task has no deadline, procrastination is very difficult to determine since the mathematically doesn't work out anymore (the variable representing delay becomes infinity). It is purely up to the person to motivate oneself to complete the task.<br /><br />
        Now that we've seen the factors that affect the type of task at hand, you can use the interactive below to see how much of an impact each factor has.
    </p>

        </div><br />
        <button id="taskButton">Start</button>
    </div>
    <h1>Personality</h1>
    <p>
        The task is not the only thing that affects procrastination, however. The more important factor is the personality of the person. No matter how structured and how easy the task is, if the person is literally a sloth, the task is not going to get done anytime soon. Let's start exploring what kind of personality traits play a role in procrastination.
    </p>
    <h3>Conscientiousness</h3>
    <p>
        A conscientious person is who wishes to what is right, especially to do one's work or duty well and thoroughly. One of the elements of conscientiousness is organization and this results in good coping strategies such as goal setting and automatic habits. Achievement motivation, enjoying performance for the sake of performance, is also an iporant aspect of conscientiousness. High conscientiousness results in less procrastination.<br /><br />
        Below is a figure that shows three different types of people: very conscientious (left), average (center), not conscientious (right). Numerical values that is used to represent procrastination is also displayed. The model will be presented later in the paper but the numbers for now should be helpful when comparing procrastination.
    </p>
    <div class="interactive_conscientiousness">
        <canvas id="con0Canvas" width="400px" height="400px" style="background:grey;"></canvas>
        <canvas id="con1Canvas" width="400px" height="400px" style="background:grey;"></canvas>
        <canvas id="con2Canvas" width="400px" height="400px" style="background:grey;"></canvas>
    </div>
    <h3>Impulsiveness</h3>
    <p>
        As seen with the type of tasks, there are multiple personality traits that play a role in procrastination. Another personality factor that we'll see is impulsiveness. Impulsive people are more likely to act on the desire of the moment. When some distractions come along that are more interesting than what they should be doing, they are likely to switch to the more interesting activitiy. This leads to procrastination.<br /><br />
        Below there are three workers: very conscientious + low impulsiveness (left), average conscientious + average impulsiveness (center), low conscientious + high impulsiveness (right).
    </p>
    <div class="interactive_imp_con">
        <canvas id="impConCanvas0" width="400px" height="400px" style="background:grey;"></canvas>
        <canvas id="impConCanvas1" width="400px" height="400px" style="background:grey;"></canvas>
        <canvas id="impConCanvas2" width="400px" height="400px" style="background:grey;"></canvas>
    </div>
    <p>
        The left and the right are very unlikely scenarios as you can see how fast the person completes the task on the left and how slow the person takes on the right. This is due the fact that compared to the extreme cases for tasks, personality traits play a bigger role in determining the procrastination.
    </p>
    <h3>Sensation-Seeking</h3>
    <p>
        This is the tendency to find exciting activities, take risks and avoid boredom. The higher someone scores on this, the higher the procrastination.
    </p>
    <h3>Self-Esteem</h3>
    <p>
        This is how one evaluates oneself. A low self-evaluation correlates with automatic thoughts about oneself and procrastinatory cognitions, which leads to more procrastination.<br /><br />
        Here are all of the personality factors that you can play with to see the affects. Compared to factors relating to tasks, personality factors will play a bigger role in procrastination.
    </p>
    <div class="personality_slider">

        <button id="persButton">Start</button>
    </div>
    <h1>Temptations</h1>
    <p>
        The last category of factors that affect procrastination is temptations. If there are no temptations (i.e. distractions) during the process of completing the task, then procrastination is likely to be low because there are less chances of distracting oneself.
    </p>
    <h3>Intensity</h3>
    <p>
        THe intensity of temptations can be related to the number of temptations and the difficulty of rejecting the temptations. The higher the intensity, the more likely the person is to procrastinate.

    <h1>Model</h1>
    <p>
        $$Procrastination = {(Im + In)^{3} \cdot (Ss + \frac{B+F}{C+P}) \cdot D \over St \cdot E \cdot (C + \frac{P}{Im})}$$
    </p>
    <p>
        I created this model so take it with a grain of salt but I did try to recreate the relationship between the factors. There are numerous factors that affect each other. For example, impulsiveness (personality) and intensity (temptations) go hand in hand in a way that if an impulsive person is met with high intensity temptations, the level of procrastination is going to increase tremendously.
    </p>
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <h3>Additional Information</h3>
    <p>
        There are many other factors that play into procrastination. For example, mood also plays a big role in procrastination. There are other factors such as fear of failure, self-efficacy, ego-resource, and others that are too complicated to be discussed and be considered for the mathematical model that I came up with. Because procrastination is something that differs with everyone, it is an idea that cannot be put into a single mathematical model. The model I came up with is a simplified version of studies going on about procrastination that was hopefully able to give you some insight into some factors that play into procrastination.

    <h3>Closing Remarks</h3>
    <p>
        Now that we know how procrastination works on the most basic form, how do we counter procrastination from happening? This is a question that researchers are trying to answer. An answer that people usually say is that learning how to delay instant gratification will help with not procrastinating. But how do we do that? How do we stop ourselves from eating the marshmallow that is right in front of us? Well the first step of solving the problem is recognizing the fact that you have a problem. If you've been reading this article and have agreed on some aspects of the discussion, then it's clear that you suffer from procrastination here and there. Recognizing which factors are affecting you while procrastinating is the next big step. While I was writing this article, I realized that the task of writing this article was very frustrating and lacked structure. By recognizing some of the problems of this task at hand, I tried to counter them by re-outlining the article so that it's easier to make progress and splitting up the work into easily doable tasks helped in finishing the article.<br /><br />
        Procrastination is something that everyone has to deal with. Whether or not you are a chronic procrastinator or just an occasional procrastinator, recognizing the factors that are currently causing you to procrastinate and coming up with plans to counter those factors will help you procrastinate less.
