    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        Before we get into procrastination, what is the key to success? This questions has been asked a countless number of times throughout human history but no one really seems to have the right answer to it. We don't even know if there is a right answer to
        this since our lives are so complicated and full of wonders and chaos.<br /><br /> A psychologist, however, attempted to answer this question through his discoveries and experiments. Before we go into it though, let's have a little bit
        of fun.<br /><br /> I happened to come across a couple $25 gift cards for Amazon. You can get yours right now below if you press "Reveal Now!". <em>But</em>, if you wait for some time, you can have an additional $25 gift card for a total of $50!<br
        /><br />

        <br /><br /><br />DON'T SCROLL PAST THIS POINT IF YOU HAVEN'T FINISHED THE GAME!
    </p>
    <p>
        <br /><br />If you're reading this, then you've either given up, accidentally lost the game, cheated the system by moving your mouse very fast past the boundary, or actually tested your patience and waited until the end (which would be 15 minutes).
        Before you try out the keys, I'm going to be totally honest with you. They're fake. I mean they were too good to be true right? Oh, and another thing. I couldn't figure out how to have the game run for 15 minutes and then reveal both of the fake
        keys. So there's that. If you waited for more than 30 minutes, then maybe an appointment with your doctor would be a good idea.
    </p>
    <h1>Marshmallow Test</h1>
    <p>
        At this point, you might be wondering what the point of that poorly designed waiting game was about. That was a replica of a well-known test called the Marshmallow Test. The Marshmallow Test is usually conducted on children and the procedure consists
        of leaving a child alone in a room with a single marshmallow in front of him/her. The child is then told that he/she can eat the marshmallow right now or wait a couple of minutes and the experimenter will bring an additional marshmallow for the
        child to enjoy. The study showed that about two-thirds of the children either ate the marshmallow right away or took a couple of minutes to think it over and then ate it. On the other hand, the other third of the children waited for the second
        marshmallow which the experimenter brought in 15 minutes later.<br /><br /> This test studied if having the ability to delay rewards has any correlation with the person's ability to become successful. It turns out that there is a significant
        difference. In fact, the experimenters surveyed the children once they were in high school and found out that those who waited for the second marshmallow had higher grades, were less stressed out, got accepted to better colleges, and were, in
        general, better off than those who did not wait for the second marshmallow.<br /><br /> For example, if you look at the charts below, the chart on the left shows the Body Mass Index (BMI) differences between the Non-Delayers (the children who
        did not wait for the second marshmallow) and the Delayers (the children who waited for the second marshmallow) recorded as a <a href="http://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(12)00737-8/pdf">follow-up study</a> years after the subjects were tested
        as children. It is clear to see that the average BMI differs by about 3 points which is a significant difference. In fact, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index#Categories">World Health Organization (WHO)</a>, 27.5
        (Non-Delayers) is considered <em>Overweight</em> and 24.4 (Delayers) is considered <em>Normal/Healthy</em>.<br /><br /> On the other hand, the chart on the right shows the Scholastic Aptitude/Assessment Test (SAT) scores between the Non-Delayers
        and Delayers. There is about 210 points difference in the total score which adds onto the significance between the difference in Non-Delayers and Delayers.<br /><br />

        <div id="chart_div1"></div>
        <div id="chart_div2"></div>
    </div>
    <p>
        These two charts, however, are only a part of a large follow-up studies conducted by multiple psychologists throughout the decades. There are other results such as divorce rate, stress level, etc. that demonstrate the better quality of life that the Delayers
        are experiencing compared to that of the Non-Delayers. So what is it about not eating a marshmallow right away that makes someone successful? The main factor that the Delayers have is the ability to delay instant gratification. The ability to
        delay instant gratification is important in that those who don't have this ability are victims of a international epidemic: procrastiation.

    <h1>Procrastination</h1>
    <p>
        Unless you're the perfect human being, you've probably been affected by procrastination. In fact, you might be procrastinating right now by reading this article. I mean I've definitely procrastianted and I am even procrastinating right now by missing
        the deadline for this article! When people see someone procrastinating, the response is usually "just do it!" But come on. Really? That's like telling a clinically depressed person "cheer up." We've all been in situations where even though we
        want to work because the deadline is imminent, we end up watching YouTube videos about <a href="https://youtu.be/7PA-GzpcgIA?t=402">how to get out of a frozen lake that you've just fallen in</a> (I live in Southern California so there's
        literally a 0% chance I'll need to learn how to do this but regardless it's an important life skill) and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8R5f2kNo0A">kayak-fisherman rescuing a wild iguana that happens to be swimming 4 miles offshore</a>.<br
        /><br /> Getting back on the subject of procrastination, first let's see some workers in action. Imagine that the red circle below is a worker and the blue rectangle is a task that needs to be done.
    </p>
    <div class="interactive">
        <canvas id="nonProCanvas" width="800px" height="400px" style="background:grey;"></canvas>
    </div>
    <p>
        Here we see a Non-Procrastinator working dilligently on a task (moving blue brick in this case). Very efficient wouldn't you say? But this is not how working usually goes.
    </p>
    <div class="interactive">
        <canvas id="proCanvas" width="800px" height="400px" style="background:grey;"></canvas>
    </div>
    <p>
        I'm sure this scenario is more relatable for most people. We are easily distracted when working on a task. But why? Why are we so easily distracted? This is because most of us don't have the ability to delay instant gratification. To elaborate, the task
        at hand is equivalent to staring at the marshmallow right in front of you. It's painful. And how can you take the pain away? By doing something else more enjoyable such as watching YouTube videos aka eating the marshmallow!
