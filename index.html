    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <h3>Key to Success</h3>
    <p>
        What is the key to success? This questions has been asked a countless
        number of times throughout human history but no one really seems to have
        the right answer to it. In fact, we don't even know if there is a right
        answer to this since our lives are so complicated and full of wonders
        and chaos.<br /><br /> A psychologist, however, attempted to answer this
        question through his research and experiments. Before we go into it though,
        let's have a little bit of fun.<br /><br /> I happened to come across a
        couple $25 gift cards for Amazon. You can get yours right now below if
        you press "Reveal Now!". <em>But</em>, if you wait for some time, you
        can have an additional $25 gift card for a total of $50!<br /><br />

        <br /><br /><br />DON'T SCROLL PAST THIS POINT IF YOU HAVEN'T FINISHED THE GAME!
    </p>
    <p>
        <br /><br />If you're reading this, then you've either given up,
        accidentally lost the game, cheated the system by moving your mouse very
        fast past the boundary, or actually tested your patience and waited until
        the end (which would be 15 minutes). Before you try out the keys, I'm
        going to be totally honest with you. They're fake. I mean they were too
        good to be true right? Oh, and another thing. I couldn't figure out how
        to have the game run for 15 minutes and then reveal both of the fake
        keys. So there's that. If you waited for more than 30 minutes, then
        maybe an appointment with your doctor would be a good idea.
    </p>
    <h3>Marshmallow Test</h3>
    <p>
        At this point, you might be wondering what the point of that poorly
        designed waiting game was about. That was a replica of a well-known test
        called the <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1972-20631-001">Marshmallow Test</a> created by Walter Mischel and Ebbe B. Ebbesen at Stanford University in 1960. The Marshmallow Test is usually conducted
        on children between the ages of 3 and 5, and the procedure consists of
        leaving a child alone in a room with a single marshmallow in front of him/her. The child is then
        told that he/she can eat the marshmallow right now or wait a couple of
        minutes and the experimenter will bring an additional marshmallow for
        the child to enjoy. The study showed that about two-thirds of the
        children either ate the marshmallow right away or took a couple of
        minutes to think it over and then ate it. On the other hand, the other
        third of the children waited for the second marshmallow which the
        experimenter brought in 15 minutes later.<br /><br /> This test studied
        if having the ability to delay instant lesser rewards has any correlation with the
        person's ability to become successful. It turns out that there is a
        significant difference between those who waited and those who did not. In fact, the experimenters surveyed the children
        once they were in high school and found out that those who waited for
        the second marshmallow had higher grades, were less stressed out, got
        accepted to better colleges, and were, in general, better off than those
        who did not wait for the second marshmallow.<br /><br /> For example,
        if you look at the charts below, the chart on the left shows the Body
        Mass Index (BMI) differences between the Non-Delayers (the children who
        did not wait for the second marshmallow) and the Delayers (the children
        who waited for the second marshmallow) recorded as a <a href="http://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(12)00737-8/pdf">follow-up
        study</a> years after the subjects were tested as children. It is clear
        to see that the average BMI differs by about 3 points which is a
        significant difference. In fact, according to
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index#Categories">World
        Health Organization (WHO)</a>, 27.5 (Non-Delayers) is considered
        <em>Overweight</em> and 24.4 (Delayers) is considered
        <em>Normal/Healthy</em>.<br /><br /> On the other hand, the chart on
        the right shows the Scholastic Aptitude/Assessment Test (SAT) scores
        between the Non-Delayers and Delayers. There is about 210 points
        difference in the total score which adds onto the significance
        between the difference in Non-Delayers and Delayers.<br /><br />

    <div id="chart_parent">
        <div id="chart_div1"></div>
        <div id="chart_div2"></div>
    </div>
    <p>
        These two charts, however, are only a part of a large follow-up studies
        conducted by multiple psychologists throughout the decades. There are
        other results such as divorce rate, stress level, etc. that demonstrate
        the better quality of life that the Delayers are experiencing compared
        to that of the Non-Delayers. So what is it about not eating a marshmallow
        right away that makes someone successful? The main factor that the
        Delayers have is the ability to delay instant gratification. In fact, the ability
        to delay instant gratification is important in that those who don't have
        this ability are victims of an international epidemic: procrastiation.

    <h1>Procrastination</h1>
    <h3>Non-Procrstinator vs. Procrastinator</h3>
    <p>
        Unless you're a perfect human being, you have probably been affected by
        procrastination. In fact, you might be procrastinating right now by
        reading this article. I mean I have definitely procrastianted and I am
        even procrastinating right now by missing the deadline for this article!
        When people see someone procrastinating, the response is usually "just
        do it!" But come on. Really? That's like telling a clinically depressed
        person "cheer up." We've all been in situations where even though we
        want to work because the deadline is imminent, we end up watching YouTube
        videos about <a href="https://youtu.be/7PA-GzpcgIA?t=402">how to get out
        of a frozen lake that you've just fallen in</a> (I live in Southern
        California so there's literally a 0% chance I'll need to learn how to do
        this but regardless it's an important life skill) and a
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8R5f2kNo0A">kayak-fisherman
        rescuing a wild iguana that happens to be swimming 4 miles offshore</a>.
        <br /><br /> Getting back on the subject of procrastination, first let's
        see some workers in action. Imagine that the red circle below is a worker
        and the blue rectangle is a task that needs to be done. To be exact, the
        task at hand is moving the blue brick from left to right.
    </p>
    <div class="interactive">
        <canvas id="nonProCanvas" width="800px" height="400px" style="background:grey;"></canvas>
    </div>
    <p>
        Here we see a Non-Procrastinator working dilligently on the task. Very efficient wouldn't you say? But this is not how working usually goes as many of you well know.
    </p>
    <div class="interactive">
        <canvas id="proCanvas" width="800px" height="400px" style="background:grey;"></canvas>
    </div>
    <p>
        I'm sure this scenario is more relatable for most people. We are easily
        distracted when working on a task. But why? Why are we so easily
        distracted? This is because most of us don't have the ability to delay
        instant gratification. To elaborate, the task at hand is equivalent to
        staring at the marshmallow right in front of you. It's painful. And how
        can you take the pain away? By doing something else more enjoyable such
        as watching YouTube videos a.k.a. eating the marshmallow!
    </p>
    <h3>Dangers</h3>
    <p>
        We all know what procrstaintion is but what exactly is the definition of procrastiation? Experts define it as the voluntary delay of some task that we intend to do, despite knowing that we will suffer as a result. The key word here is <em>suffer</em>. Procrastination is dangerous as many people will agree with. In fact, it is very easy for a person to become a chronic procrastinator, or someone who procrastinates frequently and consistently. About 20% of adults are considered chronic procrastinators and it is extremelty difficult to break out of the procrastiantion cycle.<br /><br />
        Both the ease of becoming a chronic procrastinator and the difficulty of breaking out of the procrastination cycle stem from the fact that the minds of human tend to reconstruct the sitatuions to make themselves feel beter. For example, let's say Tom is a college student who didn't study for an exam until the night before. Because he didn't have enough time to study for the exam, he recieves a solid C on the exam. Now, unless you don't really mind your GPA, C on an exam is a pretty bad score that will bring down your grade quite a bit if you're aiming for an A. Instead of thinking about the poor work habit, Tom thinks to himself, 'I could've done worse' or 'This is not bad considering I studied the night before.' This process is called downward counterfactual. Downward counterfactual thinking focuses on how the situation could have been worse. This is a common thinking process that many people go through (I'm also guilty of this). By thinking in this way, Tom is not able to focus on how he could have done better in the exam and improve his work habit; instead, by the time the next exam rolls around, he'll think to himeself that he only has to put a little bit more work since he got away with a "respectable" C when he barely studied.<br /><br />
        There are other excuses that people make to feel better about themselves. Many people will say that they work better under pressure or even say that as lnog as the work gets done, it's fine. People reconstruct situations, whether it be consciously or unconsciously, so that they always accomplish "something". As a matter of fact, procrastiation is the absence of progress; recreating the unhealthy situation into something that makes the person temporarily feel good will prevent the person from procrastinating in the future and also add another person into the large pool of chronic procrastinators in the world.

    <h3>Process</h3>
    <p>
        Now that we understand the dangers of procrastination, we need to understand how it works so that we can not only recognize when we're procrastinating but also use different countering techniques to break out of the procrastination cycle.<br /><br />
        There are many factors that play into procrastination. We will start with the most basic ones: the type of task at hand.
